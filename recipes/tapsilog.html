            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>The word Tapsilog is an acronym that stands for Tapa, Sinangag, at Itlog. These are the three components of the meal. Tapa refers to beef tapa - fried marinated beef slices.</p>
            <p>Sinangag, on the other hand, is a word used to refer to garlic fried rice. The last three letters of the word tapsilog is derived from the filipino translation for egg, which is itlog. A piece of egg is fried and forms part of the meal.</p>
            
            <h2>Ingredients</h2>
            <ul>

                <li>6 cloves crushed garlic</li>
                <li>¾ cups pineapple juice</li>

                <li>¼ teaspoon ground white pepper</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>Sinangag</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>5 cups leftover rice</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
                <li>5 cloves garlic <em>crushed</em></li>
            </ul>      

            <h2>Steps</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Prepare the tapa by placing the beef in a large bowl. Combine with all the tapa marinade ingredients. Mix well and cover the bowl. Place inside the fridge and marinate overnight.</li>
                <li>Cook the garlic fried rice (sinangag na kanin) by heating 3 tablespoons cooking oil in a pan. Add crushed garlic. Cook until garlic turns light brown. Add the leftover rice. Stir-fry for 3 minutes.</li>
                <li>Season with salt. Continue to stir-fry for 3 to 5 minutes. Set aside.</li>
                <li>Start to cook the tapa. Heat a pan and pour the marinated beef into it, including the marinade. Add ¾ cups water. Let the mixture boil. Cover the pan and continue to cook until the liquid reduces to half. Add 3 tablespoons cooking oil into the mixture. Continue to cook until the liquid completely evaporates. Fry the beef tapa in remaining oil until medium brown. Set aside.</li>
                <li>Fry the egg by pouring 1 tablespoon oil on a pan. Crack a piece of egg and sprinkle enough salt on top. Cook for 30 seconds. Pour 2 tablespoons water on the side of the pan. Cover and let the water boil. Continue to cook until the egg yolks gets completely cooked by the steam.</li>
                <li>Arrange the beef tapa, sinangag, and fried egg on a large plate to form Tapsilog. Serve with vinegar as dipping sauce for tapa.</li>
