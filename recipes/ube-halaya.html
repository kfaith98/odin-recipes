            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>From leche flan to halo-halo, the Philippines is anything but short of delicious local desserts to try. We love to experiment with various sugary ingredients to find that perfect balance of flavor. And with its comfortingly velvety texture and mildly sweet taste, Ube Halaya is among those deliciously well-balanced desserts. Some people also call it ube jalea, ube jam or ube haleya. But they all stand for the same consistently creamy and delicious dessert.</p>
            <p>Essentially, we make it by cooking up some ube or purple yams. Then we add some milk and sugar into the mix to create that unmistakable sticky and smooth texture. </p>
            
            <h2>Ingredients</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>1 lb. grated purple yam</li>
                <li>1 14 oz. can condensed milk</li>
                <li>2 cups coconut milk</li>
                <li>3 tablespoons butter</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon ube flavoring</li>
                <li>1/2 cup shredded cheddar cheese</li>
            </ul>   

            <h2>Steps</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Pour coconut milk in a cooking pot. Let boil.</li>
                <li>Stir and add the condensed milk.</li>
                <li>Once the mixture starts to boil, add the grated purple yam and ube flavoring. Continue to cook in medium heat while continuously stirring for 30 minutes.</li>
                <li>Add butter. Stir. Cook until the mixture reaches your desired thickness. (I usually cook it for 10 to 12 minutes after adding butter).</li>
                <li>Transfer to a container. Top with shredded cheese.</li>
                <li>Serve. Share and enjoy!</li>
